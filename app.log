While the technical goal was to create a functional application, the underlying challenge was to ensure that every feature we implemented served a purpose and enhanced the user experience. Reflecting on this process, I realize that my role evolved from a contributor to a strategic guide, particularly during the critical design phases of our AR food menu project.\n\nA defining moment of influence occurred during the conceptualization of the user feedback feature for our AR Menu. Initially, the team proposed a straightforward but disjointed solution which is scanning a QR code that would redirect the user to an external Google Form to leave a review. While this was technically the path of least resistance, I recognized that it broke the immersion we were striving to build. It forced the user to leave the AR environment, disrupting the "magic" of the application.\n\nDriven by a core value of responsibility, I felt compelled to intervene. I guided the team toward a more challenging but rewarding direction by implementing a native, in-app "dummy" review submission system. I argued that instead of redirecting the user, we should allow them to tap a "Rate" button on the 3D menu board, triggering a UI popup within the AR view itself. My motivation was grounded in a sense of responsibility toward the group’s academic success. I wanted to ensure our function closely aligned with the assignment rubric, which heavily incentivized advanced AR interactions over simple 2D web links. By advocating for this feature, I was not just suggesting a cooler mechanic but also safeguarding our collective grade.\n\nWhen the team agreed to this pivot and we successfully implemented the feature—complete with the sliding animations and text input fields, I experienced a profound sense of validation. Seeing the "Submit" button spawn a 3D review card in the real world was incredibly satisfying. It confirmed that my suggestion had tangible value. This emotion was rooted in the realization that my input had elevated the project from "functional" to "immersive." It reinforced my belief that taking the harder road is often worth it if it results in a superior product and a fairer outcome for the team’s effort.'}], 'model': 'deepseek-chat', 'temperature': 1.3}}

I have come to believe that an ideal leader is not merely a commander who delegates tasks and orders people around. Instead, a true leader is a solution provider. During the project, there were moments when team members struggled with the technical implementation of the features I proposed, such as the raycast handling or the script communication between panels. Rather than reacting with frustration or blame when tasks were not completed on time, I realized that leadership required empathy and active assistance. If a teammate did not understand how to execute a task, it was my role to step in—not to do it for them, but to offer the guidance and technical support needed to bridge their knowledge gap. This "servant leadership" approach fosters a supportive environment where mistakes are viewed as learning opportunities rather than failures. It challenged the traditional view of a leader as a distant overseer and replaced it with the image of a leader who is "in the trenches" with their team.\n\nLooking forward, there is one key area I will consciously strive to improve which is project progression management. While we ultimately delivered a high-quality product, the development phase often felt rushed near the deadlines, leading to unnecessary stress. Next time, I will aim to structure our timeline more rigorously to ensure deliverables are ready well before the submission date. By managing the progression better, I hope to create a buffer that allows for more testing and polish, ensuring that technical hurdles—like the ones we faced with the video player and button interactions—can be resolved without the anxiety of a ticking clock.\n\nIn conclusion, this group project was more than just a Unity assignment, it was a lesson in technical influence and empathetic leadership. I learned that influencing a team’s direction requires a strong rationale grounded in shared goals (like the rubric), and that leading a team requires the patience to teach and the foresight to plan.'}], 'model': 'deepseek-chat', 'temperature': 1.3}}
